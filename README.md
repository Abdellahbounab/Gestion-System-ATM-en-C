## üí° About the project

> _ATM is a program written in the C language that allows you to perform the following functionalities:_

- User account creation
- Keeping track of banking transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, and transfer
- Printing bank statements
- Changing passwords

This project has been an opportunity for me to learn and apply my programming skills, as well as to tackle technical challenges. I am aware that this program may have bugs or errors, but I have done my best to test and debug it.

I am grateful for this opportunity that has allowed me to acquire new programming skills, and I hope that [ATM] will be useful to you and help you achieve your goals.._

	If you encounter any problems or have any comments, please do not hesitate to contact me at abdellahbounab@gmail.com or +212615854738. Your feedback is valuable to me and will help me improve this program in the future..
